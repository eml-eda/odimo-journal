# Optimizing DNN Inference on Multi-Accelerator SoCs at Training-time

This repository contains all the code used to obtain the results presented in the manuscript "Optimizing DNN Inference on Multi-Accelerator SoCs at Training-time". The code is organized in two directories:
1. [SoC with Incompatible Data Formats](./incomp-data-fmts/), for the experiments associeted to the DIANA SoC.
2. [SoC with Specialized HW Units](./spec-hw-units/), for the experiments associeted to the Darkside SoC.
